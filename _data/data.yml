    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Nascido em 05/11/1993, sempre me identifiquei com a
        tecnologia desde pequeno, onde desmontava as coisas
        para transformar em outras com novas funcionalidades, um
        mini maker na época. Após o contato mais profundo com a
        programação, isso me despertou uma imensa vontade de
        solucionar novos problemas da melhor forma possível,
        utilizando o conhecimento adquirido com o tempo e
        aprendendo sempre coisas novas para a aplicação.
        Sou uma pessoa calma, com facilidade de relacionamento
        interpessoal, porém sou bastante persistente na busca de
        meus objetivos pessoais e profissionais.
