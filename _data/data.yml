career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I have always identified myself with
        technology since I was little, where I disassembled things
        to transform into others with new functionalities, a
        mini maker at the time. After deeper contact with the
        programming, this awoke in me an immense desire to
        solve new problems in the best possible way,
        using the knowledge acquired over time and
        always learning new things to apply.
        I'm a calm person, with good interpersonal relationship
        and I'm quite persistent in the search for
        my personal and professional goals.
